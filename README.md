## About the data

The data for this assessment are taken from this study: https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/006708.
The study looked at the "locative impersonal", i.e. *everywhere* in sentences like:

1. Is eating fish and chips a regional thing? No, these days *everywhere* in Britain eats fish and chips!
2. When Chinese food first reached Europe, people used a knife and fork, but *everywhere* in Europe eats Chinese food using chopsticks these days.

The study collected acceptability ratings of those type of sentences, using an acceptability scale from 1 to 7 (a Likert scale).
